Object Detection:
Proposed apporach for object detection: 
Backwards filtering: Find images for whichever ingredients possible 
(Many ingredients simply cannot be found or do not have adequent amount of available images)
- Target to be roughly 60 classes. 

Missing / Cannot find images for certain ingredients.
Approach 1: Remove from recipe (may remove a lot)
Approach 2: Use text detection on labels
Approach 3: Generalise, example all types of flour under flour. (May cause issues recipe matching but can be fixed in NLP)
Approach 4: Find ingredients at supermarket and take pictures.

==========================================================================================
Text detection:
TR-OCR - backed by literature 
Tesseract - easy to implement
Requires more training, try to test with conjuction with object detection to output
